# Happy-Face
# Emotion Detection in Images of Faces
To help the participants more easily track their emotions, we can develop an app that will classify their emotions based on some pictures that the volunteers will take of their facial expressions.
As a proof-of-concept, we will first train your model to detect if someone's emotion is classified as "happy" or "not happy."
To build and train this model, you have gathered pictures of some volunteers in a nearby neighborhood. The dataset is labeled.

In this repositiories, we will:
1. Learn to use Keras, a high-level neural networks API (programming framework), written in Python and capable of running on top of several lower-level frameworks including TensorFlow and CNTK. 

#### Why are we using Keras? 

* Keras was developed to enable deep learning engineers to build and experiment with different models very quickly. 
* Just as TensorFlow is a higher-level framework than Python, Keras is an even higher-level framework and provides additional abstractions. 
* Being able to go from idea to result with the least possible delay is key to finding good models. 
* However, Keras is more restrictive than the lower-level frameworks, so there are some very complex models that you would still implement in TensorFlow rather than in Keras. 
* That being said, Keras will work fine for many common models.
